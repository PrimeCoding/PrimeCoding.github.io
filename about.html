            <p>At Prime Coding, we love to make YouTube videos regarding anything that has the word "develop" or maybe even "code" we are currently based on recording tutorials on a coding language called Discord.js that uses the well known JavaScript coding language that is used in almost every project that any developer, programer or what ever you would like to call your self uses!</p>
